# Vue-Course--Practice-

### - Earlier I discovered what is React.Js and how it works. I also heard that VueJS mixes the best of React and Angular, because of that, I decided to start an online course about it.

### - In this repository I will upload the practical projects i've done over the course and i'll try to specify what proprietes i used for each.

### - Vue features that I used in the course project `The Learning Resources App`:

- data properties and methods
- components
- keep-alive with Dynamic Components :is
- v-bind:, v-on@, v-for, v-if, v-slot#
- props
- provide + inject
- custom events
- slots (simple, named, scoped), dynamic slot names
- scoped CSS
- computed Properties
- template refs
- event modifiers
- teleport

### - Another course project that I followed and developed is `Learning Experiences App` that helped me to understand better `HTTP requests` and learn how to work with `Firebase Realtime database`. Features that I used (in addition to those used in the app described above):

- v-model, v-else-if, v-else
- Vue Lifecycle Hooks (mounted)
- fetch() method (send, get, extract and show data)
- Showing a loading spinner and handle errors in case if something goes wrong (with v-if, v-else-if and v-else)
- firebase.google.com realtime database

### - Also i learned about:

- Watchers...
